This (toolbox) is a collection of functions, modules, and decorators that I use over and over again.

They include functions to set up logging, decorators to skip exceptions with defined outputs
and called functions (including logging functions), and probably many more as my personal
library expands.

All of these are available for free under no liscense, as they are simple (and yet essential
to almost any project that I write code for).  You are free to copy-paste them and not give credit
to me.  I use them so much, I think they should be part of the standard 
library :D

Many of these functions are courtesy of users on StackOverflow.com, an excellent source of
information, especially if you are a new programmer.
